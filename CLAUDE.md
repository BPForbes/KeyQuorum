# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code (and other Claude-based agents) working in this repository.

## Project overview

KeyQuorum is a secure file-sharing system centered on hardware key sharing. Files are
encrypted and bound to registered physical tokens (e.g. USB devices). Unlocking a
protected file requires presenting a quorum of the registered hardware keys, providing
layered, hardware-backed access control.

The project is a Rust Cargo crate (see `.gitignore` for Cargo-related patterns).
Private sign bridges live in `src/private_bridge.rs` and the `keyquorum` CLI.
`create` and `remove-member` generate delivery packages first and commit only after
those files are written — do not persist a live bridge before the envelopes exist.
The two must stay in step in both directions: if the commit fails, the CLI deletes
the `.kqpb` files it just wrote, because `write_owner_only` refuses to overwrite and
leftovers would block the retry.

The mailbox relay (`src/relay/`) stores opaque `.kqpb` envelopes and
the canonical *public* split-tree as JSON documents (full context). It must never
unseal envelopes or hold wrapped shares or private keys. `relay push` merges
the sender's public topology into those documents and leaves nodes the sender
does not hold in place; `tree publish` (admin) replaces a document. `relay pull`
returns a sliced copy that the personal SQLite file translates. A personal SQLite
file should keep only the subgraph that person needs (own lineage, siblings,
descendants, and established-bridge peers plus those peers' ancestors). API keys
are shown once; the relay persists only `hex(SHA-256(raw))`. Customer API keys
are issued out of band; HTTP cannot create or rotate bearers. Official
clients still only talk to a relay that proves
a KeyQuorum-root-signed cert. The mailbox host is a **hidden**
`keyquorum host` subcommand, compiled only with `--features provider`.
That feature is a build capability, not authorization. A trusted relay also
requires a KeyQuorum-signed `provider.kqcert` and the matching relay
private key; official clients challenge `POST /provider-identity` and
disconnect if the certificate, signature, expiry, capabilities, or
revocation check fails. Do not document
`host` in README or other customer-facing docs — buyers get
a URL and an API key and use `keyquorum loadkey` / `relay push` /
`relay pull`. Default `cargo build` produces `keyquorum` without that
subcommand. `keyquorum loadkey` authenticates the relay, then calls
`POST /keycheck` (no auth) and stores that hash plus a sealed bearer in the
personal SQLite file. Later commands re-check the hash and inject the
bearer. Never commit bearers, `.kqpb` files, `*.kqcert`, `*.kqrl`,
`*.kqpolicy`, provider root keys, or the relay database.

## Working conventions

- Keep changes minimal and scoped to what's requested — don't scaffold unrelated
  modules, abstractions, or tooling ahead of need.
- After Rust work, run `cargo build` (and `cargo build --features provider`
  when touching the mailbox host), `cargo fmt`,
  `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`, and
  `cargo test --locked --all-targets --all-features` before considering a change
  complete.
- Match existing code style; this repo has no established style guide yet, so follow
  standard Rust conventions (`rustfmt` defaults) unless told otherwise.
- Put tests in their own file next to the module they cover, not in an inline
  `#[cfg(test)]` module inside the implementation. Use `src/<module>/tests.rs`
  (directory module: `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`) or `src/<module>.rs` with
  `#[cfg(test)] #[path = "<module>/tests.rs"] mod tests;`. Nested files such as
  `src/relay/client.rs` load `src/relay/client/tests.rs` the same way. Shared
  test helpers belong in a `#[cfg(test)]` module, not in production code.

## Security

This project deals directly with cryptographic key material, hardware tokens, and
encrypted user files. Treat it as security-sensitive:

- Never commit private keys, tokens, `.env` files, secrets, or plaintext copies of
  protected/test files. See `.gitignore` for patterns already excluded (`*.key`,
  `*.pem`, `*.secret`, `*.token`, `*.kqkey`, `*.kqpb`, `*.kqbn`, `*.kqcert`,
  `*.kqrl`, `*.kqpolicy`, `secrets/`, `keys/`, `test-keys/`, `provider-secrets/`, etc.).
- Be extra careful with any code touching key derivation, encryption/decryption, or
  quorum/threshold logic — correctness bugs here are security bugs.
- Flag anything that looks like a hardcoded secret or credential before committing.

## Other agent instruction files

This repo also carries `AGENTS.md` (Codex and other agent tooling) and `.cursorrules`
(Cursor). Keep guidance consistent across these files when updating one.
