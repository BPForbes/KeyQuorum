//! Command-line interface over the KeyQuorum library: hardware-key
//! registration, recursive key splitting, the password vault,
//! password-locked and hardware-key-quorum-protected files (unified under
//! `access`), signature verification and private-bridge signing, share

//! has no custody story for yet — see README's Roadmap. Nothing here
//! stubs those out; they simply aren't commands.
